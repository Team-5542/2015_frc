code outlines (add to as we go on)

basic setup parts:

classes:
public class (name) { } 
sets up a class. classes are the things you place all code in and are used to reference large chunks of code

private command:


static command:


public command:


void command:


protected command:


objects:
(class) = new (name)(RobotMap.(class)); object explanation: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/object.html

commands:

extend command:
public class (class) extends (class)
command allows a class to use the assets of another class. Ex:
public class ArmUp extends CommandBase (allows ArmUp to use values from  CommandBase)


 Requires command:
 public (Name)() {
        requires(class);}
tells the class that it needs another class to function Ex:
 public ArmDown() {
        requires(arm);}
